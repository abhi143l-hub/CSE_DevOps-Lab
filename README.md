I want an app where I can store all my transaction bills and related details. The app icon should be a rupee symbol. When the app is launched, it should ask the user to select their preferred language from options such as English, Telugu, and Hindi. Based on the selected language, the app will proceed accordingly.

If the user is new to the app, it should prompt for registration by asking for their username, email ID, and password. The app should verify the password and complete the registration process.

The app should have three main slides:

The first slide should ask whether the user wants to record an income or expense. It should offer two options: automatic scan and manual entry.

In automatic scan mode, the app should scan the bill using OCR technology to extract transaction details such as date, shop name, items purchased, and amount. The scanned bill image should also be stored as proof along with the transaction details.

In manual mode, the user should be able to enter the date, bill details, amount, and upload bill proof manually.

The second slide should display all transaction details, separated into expenses and income. Total expenses and total income should be clearly shown at the top.

The third slide should include a notepad for storing notes and a reminder (alarm) feature. Users should be able to delete transaction details if needed.

The app should generate monthly and yearly reports summarizing all transactions and present these reports to the user.

In the app settings, there should be an option to set daily or weekly reminders for logging expenses to help users build a routine.

Transaction data must be stored locally on the device and simultaneously backed up in a database to keep data safe, even if the user changes phones.

The app should be developed using JavaScript, leveraging local device storage and Firebase for email verification and backup processing.
